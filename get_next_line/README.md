# get_next_line
This project is about reading a text file, one line at a time. The function _get_next_line_ returns the line read from a file descriptor (or NULL, if an error occurred or if there is nothing else to read).

Bonus: included.
The _get_next_line_ function can now manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
